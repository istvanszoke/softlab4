## Issues

### Reporting bugs

When you report a bug, it is important to share as much relevant
information as you can, including:
 * the platform (operating system and its version, architecture, etc);
 * a backtrace from the core file if the issue is a crash (this can be
invaluable);
 * if possible, a configuration that triggers the problem;
 * a detailed description of the issue.

To make it easy to read reports, if you send a configuration snippet,
or a backtrace, use
[fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown#fenced-code-blocks)
around them.

### Feature requests

We use the same [issue tracker][ar:issue-tracker] to handle features
requests (they're all tagged with the
[`enhancement`](https://github.com/gregory094/softlab4/labels/enhancement)
label. You are welcome to share your ideas on existing requests, or to
submit your own.

### Testing

## Additional resources

We are using [waffle.io][ar:waffle], built on top of
[GitHub issues][ar:issue-tracker] to track issues, feature requests
and patches.
